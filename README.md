# Vuex 5 Proposal

This is not an implementation. This repository contains only the typing of a non-validated proposal for Vuex 5.

## How to use

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

Then, open the project with vscode and edit the files in the directory `src/example1/`. In order to see the generated typing, use autocompletion to explore the variables, and hover over the variables and types with the mouse.
